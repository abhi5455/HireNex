# HireNex: WhatsApp Resume Parser

Recruiters often struggle with manually sorting through hundreds of resumes, identifying candidate details like names, emails, phone numbers, and experience levels. This process is time-consuming, error-prone, and inefficient ‚Äî especially when applications come from multiple sources.

HireNex eliminates that hassle by automating the entire process.
When a candidate sends their resume through WhatsApp, the system automatically downloads, processes, and logs their details into a Google Sheet.
A confirmation message is instantly sent back to the candidate summarizing the extracted information.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Architecture & Workflow

**1. Message Handling**  
- WhatsApp messages are received through **Twilio WhatsApp Sandbox**.  
- Each message (with or without attachments) triggers a **Flask webhook**.

**2. Backend Processing**  
- Flask handles incoming requests.  
- Files are downloaded via Twilio‚Äôs media URL.  
- Text is extracted using:
  - `pdfplumber` for PDF resumes  
  - `python-docx` for Word documents

**3. Data Parsing (AI)**  
- Extracted text is passed to **Google Gemini API**, which structures the data into JSON.  
- Parsed fields include: Name, Email, Phone, Education, Experience, and Skills.

**4. Storage**  
- Parsed JSON data is written to a **Google Sheet** using the **Google Sheets API**.  
- Each row includes a timestamp and sender‚Äôs WhatsApp number.

**5. Feedback Loop**  
- A confirmation message is sent back to the sender summarizing extracted details.
